SSL:

To add SSL support to your ticket authentication, add something like
this to your daemon:

my $opt_ssl = 1;

if ($opt_ssl) {
    $args{'SSL_key_file'} = $opt_ssl_key_file;
    $args{'SSL_cert_file'} = $opt_ssl_cert_file;
}

my $daemon = SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Daemon
    -> new ( %args )
    -> dispatch_to('WebService::MySystem')
    ;

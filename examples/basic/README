This example directory shows a skeleton of how to use
WebService::TicketAuth in a SOAP::Lite daemon architecture.

This uses a simple inheritance of the auth system into the Service
itself.  This approach exposes the new() function to the client, which
is ok in this case since we don't have to pass any parameters to new().
In a more real-world case, you'll need to do some initialization work
for the auth system, so may want to use a HAS-A relationship instead of
an IS-A inheritance one.


To use this, install the following pre-req's on the server:

   * SOAP::Lite
   * WebService::TicketAuth
   * Digest::MD5


On the client, install the following pre-req's:
   * Pod::Usage
   * Getopt::Long
   * Soap::Lite
   * Data::Dumper
   * Storable
   * Term::ReadKey


Then run the server:

   $ ./auth_server.pl

And run the client like this:

   $ ./login.pl admin
   Password:   [admin]

   $ ./auth_client.pl

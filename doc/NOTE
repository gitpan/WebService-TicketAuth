Bryce,

If you're talking about this module [1] feel free to use and modify
it any way you want. It hasn't been uploaded to CPAN only because I
wrote it as an example on how it can be done, and it's very much
specific to the way SOAP::Lite does things.

Technically it's under the same license as Perl itself; if you can
keep my name in it is good, if not, that's fine too. If you need
anything more formal (like a statement that it's distributed under
such and such license) let me know.

Paul.
